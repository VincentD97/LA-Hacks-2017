# LA-Hacks-2017

This is a group project built by Chaoran Lin, Haoqing Dong, Muchen Liu and Shiqi Wang during LA Hacks 2017.

XXX is a website that provides students at UCLA opportunities to exchange swipes.

Both students who want to provide swipes and students who need swipes from others can sumbit posts to the website. Users can also use the search engine on the top of the page to find a most suitable swipe provider for them, then they are able to contact the provider by email within just one click.
